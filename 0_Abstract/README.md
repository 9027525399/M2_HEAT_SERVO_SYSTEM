## M2_Simple-Traffic-Light-System-with-Pedestrian-Crossing

# Introduction
The use of personal vehicles is very common now a days and a result, the number of vehicles on the roads are exponentially increasing. Roads without any supervision or guidance can lead in to traffic congestions and accidents.Traffic light controller helps to manage the traffic and to maintain proper traffic management. These systems are placed at the intersections of the road or at the crossings to avoid congestions and accidents. The systems indicate to the driver by using different colours of light. Therefore it is simple to avoid congestion at the intersections.

This project is the traffic light controller by using atmega 328. It is an electronic project by which we will get knowledge about traffic lights and how they work. This project is the simple version of a traffic light system where we have demonstrated it for three sides or ways.

Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals are signalling devices that are used to control the flow of traffic. Generally, they are positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc. and alternate the priority of who has to wait and who has to go
This is a simple project that helps to controll the traffic signals and allow the common people cross the road in ease.
# Features
Simple, low-cost, and real time traffic signal system that aims to overcome many problems and improves the traffic system and the system is based on ATMEGA 328.
